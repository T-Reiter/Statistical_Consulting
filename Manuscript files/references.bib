	abstract = {Conjoint experiments are fast becoming one of the dominant experimental methods within the social sciences. Despite recent efforts to model heterogeneity within this type of experiment, the relationship between the conjoint design and lower-level causal estimands is underdeveloped. In this article, we clarify how conjoint heterogeneity can be construed as a set of nested, causal parameters that correspond to the levels of the conjoint design. We then use this framework to propose a new estimation strategy, using machine learning, that better allows researchers to evaluate treatment effect heterogeneity. We also provide novel tools for classifying and analyzing heterogeneity postestimation using partitioning algorithms. Replicating two conjoint experiments, we demonstrate our theoretical argument and show how this method helps estimate and detect substantive patterns of heterogeneity. To accompany this article, we provide new a R package, cjbart, that allows researchers to model heterogeneity in their experimental conjoint data.},

	abstract = {Estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects is an active area of research. Most of the existing methods, however, focus on estimating the conditional average treatment effects of a single, binary treatment given a set of pre-treatment covariates. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the heterogeneous causal effects of high-dimensional treatments, which poses unique challenges in terms of estimation and interpretation. The proposed approach finds maximally heterogeneous groups and uses a Bayesian mixture of regularized logistic regressions to identify groups of units who exhibit similar patterns of treatment effects. By directly modeling group membership with covariates, the proposed methodology allows one to explore the unit characteristics that are associated with different patterns of treatment effects. Our motivating application is conjoint analysis, which is a popular type of survey experiment in social science and marketing research and is based on a high-dimensional factorial design. We apply the proposed methodology to the conjoint data, where survey respondents are asked to select one of two immigrant profiles with randomly selected attributes. We find that a group of respondents with a relatively high degree of prejudice appears to discriminate against immigrants from non-European countries like Iraq. An open-source software package is available for implementing the proposed methodology.},

	abstract = {Conjoint analysis is a popular experimental design used to measure multidimensional preferences. Many researchers focus on estimating the average marginal effects of each factor while averaging over the other factors. Although this allows for straightforward design-based estimation, the results critically depend on the ways in which factors interact with one another. An alternative model-based approach can compute various quantities of interest, but requires correct model specifications, a challenging task for conjoint analysis with many factors. We propose a new hypothesis testing approach based on the conditional randomization test ({CRT}) to answer the most fundamental question of conjoint analysis: Does a factor of interest matter in any way given the other factors? Although it only provides a formal test of these binary questions, the {CRT} is solely based on the randomization of factors, and hence requires no modeling assumption. This means that the {CRT} can provide a powerful and assumption-free statistical test by enabling the use of any test statistic, including those based on complex machine learning algorithms. We also show how to test commonly used regularity assumptions. Finally, we apply the proposed methodology to conjoint analysis of immigration preferences. An open-source software package is available for implementing the proposed methodology. The proposed methodology is implemented via an open-source software R package {CRTConjoint}, available through the Comprehensive R Archive Network https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/{CRTConjoint}/index.html.},

	abstract = {The Russian war on Ukraine constitutes an attack on a sovereign country in clear violation of international law -- a bad omen for autocratic challenges to the liberal, rule-based order promoted by Western democracies. Are Western democracies ready for this challenge? Their governments attempt to commit themselves to assist Ukraine for `as long as it takes'. We argue that the credibility of such announcements and the ability of Western governments to provide long-term economic and military support depends on the extent of resolve of their respective electorates. Building on the literature on support for war, we are the first to study citizens' multidimensional assessments of the conditions and risks of supporting Ukraine.     With support for Ukraine being increasingly politicized within the {US} and European countries, how reliable is the backing of Ukraine among the mass public of the top 5 supporters ({US}, {UK}, Germany, Italy, and France)? Drawing on conjoint and vignette survey experiments (N=10,000), we provide comparative evidence for populations split on this issue. On average, the full self-determination of Ukraine prevails in citizens' assessments but is not unconditional: strategic risks and the human, but not economic, costs of war are relevant constraints. However, around a quarter of the population does not care about outcomes for Ukraine -- while another quarter shows unconditional support. These results indicate limits to strong resolve against autocratic challenges inherent to the set-up of decision-making in liberal democracies, informing current policy debates.},

	abstract = {In this article, we introduce the {BART} R package which is an acronym for Bayesian additive regression trees. {BART} is a Bayesian nonparametric, machine learning, ensemble predictive modeling method for continuous, binary, categorical and time-to-event outcomes. Furthermore, {BART} is a tree-based, black-box method which fits the outcome to an arbitrary random function, f , of the covariates. The {BART} technique is relatively computationally efficient as compared to its competitors, but large sample sizes can be demanding. Therefore, the {BART} package includes efficient state-of-the-art implementations for continuous, binary, categorical and time-to-event outcomes that can take advantage of modern off-the-shelf hardware and software multi-threading technology. The {BART} package is written in C++ for both programmer and execution efficiency. The {BART} package takes advantage of multi-threading via forking as provided by the parallel package and {OpenMP} when available and supported by the platform. The ensemble of binary trees produced by a {BART} fit can be stored and re-used later via the R predict function. In addition to being an R package, the installed {BART} routines can be called directly from C++. The {BART} package provides the tools for your {BART} toolbox.},
